## Description

_Duration: 1 Week_

This is a full-stack CRUD feedback form built with React and Redux which collects user feedback over 4 views. Users may go back and change previous responses, and there is a review page to confirm answers before submitting their responses to the database. Number inputs are limited to 1-5, and users are prompted to change any answer that is incomplete or outside the allowed range.

All existing feedback is displayed at the route /admin. Most recent feedback appears at the top of the list. Users may permanently delete existing feedback, and a modal prompts the user to confirm or cancel this action. Users may also flag/unflag feedback items, and these changes are reflected in the database.
